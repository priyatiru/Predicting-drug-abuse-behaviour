Kentucky have only one player next years roster who can play Center bouncy non-elite recruit.Would 
Matt Haarms pass start the for Kentucky start for national title contender Texas Tech 
Heres the thing Roy absolutely make the right decision get both Caleb Love amp Davis Jeremiah Francis have 
Two transfer one offseason out UNC Both guy be 100 recruit over you believe that Have 
not Haarms guy all but Texas Tech and Kentucky both need start center Texas Tech that put

This G-League program which far and away the most entice all the non-college options that 
Every top player will now approach with this G-League offer Six the top guy this year hav 
G-League reach out him with new offer that just come about didnt reach out them
