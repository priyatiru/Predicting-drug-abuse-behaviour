Most Efficient W-Key game Round yesterday NAE Duos Cash amp 30th Place 
Yeah when say 50/50 mean equally likely win/lose the fight didnt mean fight 50/50 zone 
The expect value 50/50 fight that gain you slightly better position than you woul 
completely agree with that and implement some super low elim cap make elims worth 
That have nothing with the format be kill heavy You could say the same about plac 
For open weekly cup personally find quite entertain watch good players Key 
respect that opinion and tbh personally dont have strong opinion Elim value the moment 
agree and the good players be gon W-Key the bad players because they can and want get more point 
NAE Top 200 Teams get most their point through Elims:4/30/20 4pt elims 180 2005/4/20 4pt elims 
NAE Top 200 Teams Avg Total Points come from Elims:4/30/20 4pt elims 59.1 5/4/20 4pt elims 61.5 
comparison Point Elim Format and Point Elim Format thread NAE Top 200 Teams Elims per Game:4/30/20 
Here where the Top 1000 duos from yesterday cash cup fall term where their point come from Elims vs. 
Depends what the cap super low cap would change player behavior n't know that want that though 
accept the fact that good players be gon play aggressively weekly cup 
Not say tell you but the point format change from pts per elim pts per elim do n't make lobby mor 
someone say stat 
short stream today boys 
damn miss cbb 
Maybe can have team 197-204 each 2v2 box fight see which team will the last four 
LOOOL just mean the should expand the field type thing but enjoy that hypothetical 
This sound exactly like the conversation that the college basketball community have every year after seed beat 
Taking the result round and round for single team 

you grow play chess competitively Youre your way PhD only lowl 
203 
211 
Might tad higher than this but should somewhere around 200 point for NAE today 
Dont really have favorite NBA team but go Duke now kinda root for the Pels since they have 
Zion Williamson 
Once some the earlier regions finish their cup will have better idea where the cutoff will fall and 
Tomorrows Duos Cash Cup have format that award point per elim instead points.Im estimate the new 
Standards for both elims and placement be higher the new format 
Mostly depend there be any big change player behavior result the change point form 
you place 5th the old format the placement pts you get cover 80.5 the 8.7 point you need that 
You would have 252 point which shy the 266 threshold for Top 200 
Its only game but yeah 
Obviously this with the point elims things may little different tomorrow 
Old format cash cup 4/15/20 Top 200 8.7 point per game total New format cash cup 4/30/20 Top 200 
promise you there will never weekly cash cup with players half and half 
Did for Aqua and Stompy well 
let goo 
you think Unknown and Khanada didnt W-key the old cash cup 
yeah ... double check What you think the number should

already feel bad about this sorry everyone 

pleaseee remove sbmm from tournaments The fact that two game the same tournament can starkly different ridiculous 
you be able some glitch where you can become invisible 
only for solo fncs since the bug occur only team modes Still go duo arena 
Btw the reason use that variable the Y-axis instead just raw point that you get from placement that 
This not stamp approval the entire cash cup system whole There be other factor that cause issu 
This format do better job award placement point but its definitely not perfect.Points award 

The new Cash Cup placement format step the right direction Still some work but the old placement 
feel like youve be do this challenge every tournament the past 
holy shit 
yeah thats point People be make like the new format with 4pt elims make the lobby significan 
Obviously you may think that elims be too valuable the first place which fair but think this new forma
